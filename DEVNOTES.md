###### How are block elements rendered:

     a line
     <div>headline</div>

as

      <p>a line</p>
      <div>headline</div>

###### Can we accept that

      a line
      prefix <div>headline</div>

is rendered as

      <p>a line
      prefix<div>headline</div></p>

I guess we can if someone wants to write code like that she shall bare with the consequences
